<p>Oier is my name. Two, is a word play between the number 2
and "Txu". All pronounced similarly.</p>
<p>Txu is a polite diminutive for people in basque,
similar to kun/san/chan used in japanese. Oiertxu in basque is similar
to Oier-kun, and when you are creating users in internet usually they
force you to put numbers in nicknames because your name is taken,
so I thought to put two instead of number 2 once and now i use oiertwo
forever.</p>
